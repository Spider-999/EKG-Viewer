# EKG-Viewer
An ekg viewer I made for a computer science course in college. I used libraries such as pandas, numpy, tkinter, matplotlib and wfdb(waveform database package).
The ekg viewer plots the ekg of a patient chosen by the user from a dropdown menu and shows the pathologies of the patient and their heart bpm.
I got the EKG data from https://physionet.org/content/but-pdb/1.0.0/
The path in the code should be changed to match your own project path!!!
